<h3><strong>Time is on my side.</strong><h3>

        In terms of the visual format of the page, I think my hierarchy makes sense and my favorite aspect of the site is definitely the navigation buttons. I wanted to play with buttons this time around and researched ways to create a sleek, pill-shaped button design. Originally, I wanted to do an overlay as depicted in one of the code pen sketches we did in class, but my code in java wasn't working very well, so I decided to go with a very simple layout. I think it could definitely use some work and, had I had the time, I would've incorporated more icon illustrations for each category and the overlay feature as well. Overall, the design is alright, but the code needs some fixing.

<h3><strong>Coolors</strong><h3>
<br />
<h4><em>January 19, 2016</em><h4>
<br />
<p style= font-weight:normal;>Coolors is a really useful design resource for any graphic artist stuck in a creative block. Coolors is an application that allows the user to create a customized palette by randomly rotating through swatches that will always remain mathematically harmonious to one another. If the user likes a particular swatch, the app provides the option to lock the swatch and rotate the other colors in the palette around the locked swatches. The interface is incredibly user-friendly and designed with a very simple, yet modern aesthetic. Another great feature of the app is its ability to identify each color by HSB, RGB, CMYK, PMS, COPIC, or a hexadecimal code. The typographic visual hierarchy makes sense in that the hexadecimal code is placed in the center and bolded in a larger font size. However, a problem I have encountered with the app is how the instructions to use the space bar to randomize the palette aren't very clear. There is a tiny footer explaining how to use the app and, while the navigation is quite simple, there should be an alert message that initializes the app with a clear set of instructions. Overall, a super handy app with a very clean interface.

<h3><strong>Facebook</strong><h3>
<br />
<h4><em>January 7, 2016</em><h4>
<br />
<p style= font-weight:normal;>Facebook is an interface I'm very familiar with because I use it practically almost everyday of my life. It's evolved so much through time, and I've witnessed it grow from when I was an 11-year-old starting out in the world of social media till now. The top navigation bar is extremely simple and easy to use, but the left navigation bar actually has a lot of clutter and icons that I've never even touched. If I were to make a suggestion on improving the design, I would program each section on the left toolbar to collapse so that it looks cleaner and more organized. I would also program each button to have a minus sign next to it so that the user has the option of simply deleting unnecessary items off the list, as quickly as possible. Many users rely on Facebook's events feature to keep updated on the latest parties, concerts or even more intimate get-togethers. I would design the interface to include a very simple calendar with event dates highlighted for upcoming events and highlight in green the events the user has already promised to attend and in yellow for events the user hasn't yet decided to go to, but remains interested in. In terms of the newsfeed itself, I really like how easy it is now to update your status, upload photos, and receive recent news or posts by friends and organizations you are passionate about. In comparison to the earlier days of the social media application, Facebook has really done an exceptional job at bringing the online community together and even connecting long lost relatives to their distant families via a digital platform.
