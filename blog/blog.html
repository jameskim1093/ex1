<h3><strong>Facebook</strong><h3>

<p style= font-weight:normal;>Facebook is an interface I'm very familiar with because I use it practically almost everyday of my life. It's evolved so much through time, and I've witnessed it grow from when I was an 11-year-old starting out in the world of social media till now. The top navigation bar is extremely simple and easy to use, but the left navigation bar actually has a lot of clutter and icons that I've never even touched. If I were to make a suggestion on improving the design, I would program each section on the left toolbar to collapse so that it looks cleaner and more organized. I would also program each button to have a minus sign next to it so that the user has the option of simply deleting unnecessary items off the list, as quickly as possible. Many users rely on Facebook's events feature to keep updated on the latest parties, concerts or even more intimate get-togethers. I would design the interface to include a very simple calendar with event dates highlighted for upcoming events and highlight in green the events the user has already promised to attend and in yellow for events the user hasn't yet decided to go to, but remains interested in. In terms of the newsfeed itself, I really like how easy it is now to update your status, upload photos, and receive recent news or posts by friends and organizations you are passionate about. In comparison to the earlier days of the social media application, Facebook has really done an exceptional job at bringing the online community together and even connecting long lost relatives to their distant families via a digital platform.
